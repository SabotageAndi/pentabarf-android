=================

This repository contains the [Android](http://www.android.com/) application for
making the schedule of [Linuxwochen Wien 2013] (http://www.linuxwochen.at) available offline.
[Linuxdays Graz](http://linuxtage.at/) available offline.

It's based on [mika's pentabarf-android fork](https://github.com/mika/pentabarf-android) which is based on [mrud's pentabarf-android
fork](https://github.com/mrud/pentabarf-android) which itself is based on the
original [fosdem-android](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fosdem-android/) app.

This app uses the schedule generated by [Pentabarf](http://pentabarf.org/), the
open source conference planning software. 

The app is available for download in the Google Play Store:
