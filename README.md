pentabarf-android
=================

This repository contains the [Android](http://www.android.com/) application for
making the schedule of [Linuxdays Graz](http://linuxtage.at/) available offline.

It's based on [mrud's pentabarf-android
fork](https://github.com/mrud/pentabarf-android) which itself is based on the
original [fosdem-android](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fosdem-android/) app.

This app uses the schedule generated by [Pentabarf](http://pentabarf.org/), the
open source conference planning software. 

Download the [GLT 2012 Android
app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.linuxtage.glt12) Android
app from the Google Play Store.
